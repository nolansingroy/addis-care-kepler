## **üö® High-Risk Area Identification Methodology**

### **Risk Factors We Can Measure (Real Data)**

Since we don't have actual Medicaid enrollment data, we identify high-risk areas based on **provider characteristics** that correlate with Medicaid dependency:

#### **1. HCBS-Dominant Areas (High Risk)**
- **Criteria**: >70% HCBS providers in ZIP code
- **Rationale**: HCBS agencies rely heavily on Medicaid funding
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Policy changes directly affect service delivery

#### **2. High Provider Density Areas (High Risk)**
- **Criteria**: >100 total providers in ZIP code
- **Rationale**: More providers competing for limited Medicaid dollars
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Higher operational costs and vulnerability to funding cuts

#### **3. ALF-Heavy Areas (Moderate Risk)**
- **Criteria**: >50% ALF providers in ZIP code
- **Rationale**: Mixed funding models create uncertainty
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Medicaid-dependent residents at risk

#### **4. Rural/Underserved Areas (High Risk)**
- **Criteria**: Moderate provider counts with high concentration
- **Rationale**: Limited alternative funding sources
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Higher dependency on Medicaid

### **Risk Score Calculation**

```python
# Risk score formula
total_risk_score = (
    (hcbs_percentage * 0.01) +      # Higher HCBS % = higher risk
    (total_providers * 0.01) +      # Higher density = higher risk
    (alf_percentage * 0.005)        # Moderate ALF risk
)
```
